## Project structure in general

## Style

As said we use TypeScript above JavaScript ES6 meaning we use **import**,**export** statements
instead of require. And have the newest javascript features available

Additional we use **prettier.js** for automatic code styling. Here you should also copy an existing
**.prettierc** form an existing project.

Most modern IDEs support to file watchers which then can execute scripts on changes.
Setup **prettier.js** and **build.js** te be run on file changes.

## TypeScript

The file **@OneCoreTypes.d.ts** defines the types this project uses as well as exports
