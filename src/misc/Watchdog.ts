/**
 * This is a software based watchdog.
 *
 * It fires the onTimeout event when a specified amount of time has passed before it was reset.
 *
 * At the beginning the watchdog is not enabled. You have to call enable() in order for it to
 * work. If you change the timeout after the watchdag was enabled the new timeout will be used
 * only after the next restart call.
 *
 * Future improvement:
 * Just using setTimeout has the drawback, that if the main event loop gets stuck e.g. in the
 * I/O phase, then the timeout won't fire until it is unstuck. This can be improved, by also
 * scheduling a check in the I/O phase and the Immediate phase of the event loop. But this would
 * require more resources and would make the code much more complex.
