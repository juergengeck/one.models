/**
 * This class is for overriding the parenthesis operator "()" of a class.
 *
 * Javascript / typescript don't support overriding operators. But you can use a trick by creating a function when 'new'
 * is called and making the original class a prototype of the returned function.
 *
 * Deriving from 'Function' is not really required, but with it you get all the members of a function object.
 *
 * Note: This redefines the prototype of a function with setPrototypeOf. According to MDN this might come with severe
 * speed penalties, because this will disable some optimizations in certain runtimes.

 *
 * **Q**: How does this thing work?<br>
 * **A**: Read about prototype inheritance, then you might understand the explanation at the top of this comment. Also the
 *    first link will show you how it is done in javascript which is the same.

 *
 * **Q**: Why is the functor interface needed?<br>
 * **A**: Because it extends the type of the class in a way that the class is considered callable by typescript.
 *    It does not make it callable - that is achieved by the setPrototypeOf call in the class constructor
